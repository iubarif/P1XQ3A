            "description": "Dare2Draw is happy to have Ramona Fradon join us for a Chat, on April 20th, at YouTube Space NY. Interview by Edie Nugent.\n\nDare2Draw at Google - YouTube Space NY\nRamona Fradon, working in what was primarily a menâ€™s industry, drew comics for DC in the 1950s and 1960s. She was inducted into the Women Cartoonists Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nPlease RSVP, for your event FREE Tickets: https://goo.gl/forms/zo3elf31rC4zvAEs2\n\nRAMONA FRADON -\n(Artist/Co-Creator: Metamorpho; Artist: Aquaman, Brenda Starr)\n\nRamona Fradon is a pioneer for women in comics and one of the greatest comic book artists of DCâ€™s Gold/Silver Age. Ramona began working in comics in 1950. As a woman working in a male-dominated industry, she challenged the status quo and broke new ground for women but never received the same type of acclaim as her male peers.\n\nRamona got work in cartooning shortly after she studied at Parsons School of Design and the Art Studentsâ€™ League of New York, at DC Comics, where she really came into her own as a comics artist. Her Aquaman work is known to be deceptively simple, combining an excellent design sense, a flair for narrative and a cartoonistâ€™s skill at expressive faces. \n\nShe illustrated Aquaman until 1960 and drew short features for Timely and DC. She co-created Metamorpho. She illustrated mystery stories and popular titles such as Plastic Man, Plop, Fighter Fighters, Super Friends and Brenda Starr, working in multiple genres with a flair for the comedic. She has done work for Nickelodeon, Bongo, DC, Archie Comics and Marvel, continuing to showcase her flexibility, draftsmanship, wit and style. In 2006, she was inducted into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame. Sheâ€™s still an inspirational voice in comics, doing regular commissions and convention appearances.\n\nCharacters Created by Ramona Fradon:\nMetamorpho, Tempest, Jayna, Gleek, Zan, Fire, Doctor Mist, Olympian, Sapphire Stagg, Atlanna, Simon Stagg, Icemaiden, Java, Dolphin, Topo.\n\nFor more of her work: http://www.catskillcomics.com/Fradon.htm",
